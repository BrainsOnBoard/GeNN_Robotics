## Generic tool for controlling a Norbot
This tool opens a network connection for remote control on a Norbot. In
addition, it also checks for the presence of a joystick, in which case this can
also be used to control the robot, and, if a camera is present, this will also
be streamed over the network.

The idea is that we can remotely control a Norbot without writing separate
programs depending on which peripherals we are using.

# Arden et al. Model of navigation
Published model of navigation using a spiking model of the ant mushroom body:
* ``genn-buildmodel.sh model.cc`` to build network model
* ``make`` to build simulator. Spikes can be recorded with ``RECORD_SPIKES=1`` option and synaptic weights with ``RECORD_TERMINAL_SYNAPSE_STATE=1`` option.
* ``./ant_word ROUTE_FILE_NAME`` to run the simulator.
* GLFW3 and GLEW are required - on Ubuntu can be installed with ``sudo apt-get install libglew-dev libglfw3-dev``

If a route filename is passed to the simulator, simulated ant will be trained on the route and then attempt to repeat it. Otherwise arrows keys allow manual ant exploration, snapshots can be trained with space and matched with enter. The visualisation in this example is a C++ port of the Matlab code publically avaiable at www.insectvision.org/walking-insects/antnavigationchallenge.

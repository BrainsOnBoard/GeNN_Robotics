# Example image databases
This folder contains two example image databases, one each of the grid and route
types. This is the format used in the
[``ImageDatabase``](../../navigation/image_database.h) class.

These databases were generated with the
[ant_world_db_creator](../../tools/ant_world_db_creator) tool.

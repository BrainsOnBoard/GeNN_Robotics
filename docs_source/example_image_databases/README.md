# Example image databases
This folder contains two example image databases, one each of the grid and route
types. This is the format used in the
[``ImageDatabase``](https://brainsonboard.github.io/bob_robotics/classBoBRobotics_1_1Navigation_1_1ImageDatabase.html) class.

These databases were generated with the
[ant_world_db_creator](https://github.com/BrainsOnBoard/bob_robotics/tree/master/tools/ant_world_db_creator) tool.
